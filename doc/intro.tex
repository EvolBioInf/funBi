A genome is sequenced in a laboratory and analyzed on the
computer. The computing part is called bioinformatics. In this two
hour practical we encounter some of the fundamental techniques useful
in bioinformatics, which are how to
\begin{itemize}
\item use the Unix command line
\item typeset words and figures
\item handle genome data
\end{itemize}
We assume you are now sitting in front of a computer with the Unix
command line running in a terminal. To make the most of what's ahead,
you should be comfortable using a standard keyboard. If you'd like to
test your typing skills, try some of the exercises in a course on
touch typing, for example, \ty{gtypist}.
