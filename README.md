# [funBi](https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/azm5ImqUpGUYdRw): Fun with Bioinformatics
## Authors
Beatriz Vieira Mourato and Bernhard Haubold
## Description
This is a two hour practical for highschool students. Our aim is to
give them a first taste of three things useful in bioinformatics:

- Unix command line
- typesetting in LaTeX
- handling genome data

These three things are explored with the ultimate goal of using LaTeX
to draw the 519 genes along the genome of *Mycoplasmoides genitalium*,
which has one of the smallest genomes of any free-living organism.
